# DataTypeConverter
The purpose of this project is to become more familiar with bit-level representations 
of integers and floating point numbers.

This program takes

• a file containing signed integers, unsigned integers and floating point numbers
• the byte ordering type (Little Endian or Big Endian),
• the size of the floating point data type (the size of both signed and unsigned 
integers are 2 bytes),
as input and converts the contents of the file to hexadecimal according to the predefined 
format and gives the converted data as output.
